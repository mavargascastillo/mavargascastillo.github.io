¡Hola! My name is Miguel Ángel Vargas and I am a freshman at Fordham University studying Mathematics and Finance. I am based
in New York but I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. My interests lie in how mathematics can be applied to the financial
services, more particulary to quantitative trading methods. In this website you can find some of the projects I have worked on
or I am currently working on.

I also like football, chess, and books. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
