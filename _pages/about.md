¡Hola! My name is Miguel Ángel Vargas and I am a third year uni student majoring in Mathematics and Finance at Fordham University. I am based
in New York but I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. 
I like mathematics and trading. 
Lately I have gotten into the DeFi/Crypto space.

I also like football, chess, and books.

*currently studying abroad in Singapore (Fall 2025).
