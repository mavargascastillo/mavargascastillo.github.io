¡Hola! My name is Miguel Ángel Vargas and I am a freshman at Fordham University studying Mathematics and Finance. I am based
in New York but I was born and raised in Madrid, Spain. My interests lie in how mathematics can be applied to the financial
services, more particulary to quantitative trading methods. In this website you can find some of the projects I have worked on
or I am currently working on.

I also like football, chess, and books.
