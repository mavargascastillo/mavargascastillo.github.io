Photo from my graduation day. Thanks to my parents, I am the person who I am today. My mother has taught me never
to give up, be kind to people, and to never stop pursuing my dreams, while my father has emphasized values ​​such as 
integrity, honesty, and coherence. Together, they have instilled in me the importance of being the best
version of myself. I owe them everything; they will always be a part of my achievements.
